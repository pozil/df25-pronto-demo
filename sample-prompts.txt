How many storefronts are registered in my org?


Create a latestOrderCard LWC that displays the latest confirmed customer order for a given storefront.
Create an OrderController.getLatestOrder AuraEnabled Apex method that takes the Storefront record ID and fetches these Order fields: name, status, total amount, order time.
The LWC should go on the Storefront record page and grab the record ID from there. Use a wire to call getLatestOrder with the record ID.
Write the related Apex test.


Deploy the metadata and run the OrderController Apex tests.


Run Code Analyzer on the OrderController class.


Add a button that opens the order record page


Use the standard:order_item icon for the card amd move the button to the "action" section of the card.


Rewrite the LWC to use a lightning record form using two columns display mode. Import individual field names from @salesforce/schema.
