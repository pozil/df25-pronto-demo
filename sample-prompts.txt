How many storefronts are registered in my org?


Create a latestOrderCard LWC that displays the latest confirmed customer order for a given storefront.
Create an OrderController.getLatestOrder AuraEnabled Apex method that takes the Storefront record ID and fetches these Order fields: name, status, total amount, order time.
The LWC should go on the Storefront record page but don't modify the flexipage.
Grab the record ID from the current page and use a wire to call getLatestOrder with the record ID.
Write the related Apex test, skip the LWC tests.


Deploy the metadata and run the OrderController Apex tests.


Run Code Analyzer on the OrderController class.


Add a button that opens the order record page


Use the standard:order_item icon for the card. Move the button to the "action" section of the card and make it a button icon.


Rewrite the LWC to use a lightning record form with columns="2".
Keep the same fields that are currently displayed. Pass the fields to the form component with a JS getter.
Import individual field names from @salesforce/schema.
Skip the LWC tests.
