Open my default org

How many storefronts are registered in my org?

Create a latestOrderCard LWC that displays the details of the latest confirmed customer order for a given storefront.
The LWC should go on the Storefront record page and grab the record ID from there.
Create an OrderController.getLatestOrder Apex method that the LWC can use and write the related Apex test.

Deploy the metadata and run the Apex tests

Add a button that opens the order record page

Move the button to the "action" section of the card.

Switch the order view to use a record form LWC using two columns display mode.
